# RackStep App Template

This is a fully functional example app built using [RackStep] (https://github.com/mfdavid/rackstep). You may use this
as the starting point to your own app.


## Dependancies

This example app was developed and tested with Ruby 2.4.1. The only hard
dependency is RackStep and Rack itself, but there are a few others recommended gem
dependancies:
- Puma: fast rack-compatible server that can be used for production.
- simplecov: a simple way to generate statistics about you unit tests coverage.


## How to

To run the app, just start a rack compatible server like rackup, shotgun or
puma. This app is ready to be deployed at Heroku.com.
